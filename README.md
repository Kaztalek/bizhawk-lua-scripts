# BizHawk Lua Scripts
> for BizHawk 2.10

Provided as-is. A lot of these scripts are old and copied over from much older BizHawk versions, so they may not work (or be of any value).\
Scripts are for the following games:

- Hachiemon `GBA`
- Junkoid `NES`
- Magical Pop'n `SNES`
- Majora's Mask `N64` (https://github.com/Kaztalek/mm-lua-scripts/tree/main)
- Super Junkoid `SNES`
- Super Metroid `SNES`

Feel free to just download the specific scripts you want (just check for file imports and download those as well).

If you want to clone the whole repo locally, I recommend renaming the `Lua` directory included with BizHawk to something else, then clone this repo to be BizHawk's new `Lua` directory.\
Note that the `majoras_mask` directory is a submodule, so clone and update accordingly!
```bash
# Run this in the BizHawk 2.10 root directory
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Kaztalek/bizhawk-lua-scripts.git Lua
```
