# BizHawk Lua Scripts
> for BizHawk 2.10

Provided as-is. A lot of these scripts are old and copied over from much older BizHawk versions, so they may not work (or be of any value).\
Scripts are for the following games:

- Hachiemon
- Junkoid
- Magical Pop'n
- Majora's Mask (https://github.com/Kaztalek/mm-lua-scripts/tree/main)
- Super Metroid

Feel free to just download the specific scripts you want.\
If you want to clone the whole repo locally, I recommend renaming the `Lua` directory included with BizHawk to something else, then clone this repo to be BizHawk's new `Lua` directory.\
You can also `git clone git@github.com:Kaztalek/mm-lua-scripts.git N64` to get the Majora's Mask scripts into the `N64` directory of this repo.
